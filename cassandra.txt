Setup cassandra on docker
	//cassandra
	docker pull cassandra
	
	//run cassandra image
	sudo docker run --name cassandra -d cassandra
	
	//start cassandra cqlsh
	sudo docker run -it --link cassandra:cassandra --rm cassandra sh -c 'exec cqlsh "$CASSANDRA_PORT_9042_TCP_ADDR"'

Notable points
	coloumn oriented db
	created at facebook
	distribution design on amazon's dynamo
	data desing on google bigdata

Features
	Elastic scalabilty - add more hardware
	No single point failure. built in dynamo style replication
	linearly scalable- increase throughput by increase in node
	fexible data storage - store
	write fast
	support transactions
    All the nodes in a cluster play the same role.
    Each node is independent and at the same time interconnected to other nodes.
    Each node in a cluster can accept read and write requests, regardless of where the data is actually located in the cluster.
    When a node goes down, read/write requests can be served from other nodes in the network.

Important Notes
	Cassandra uses the Gossip Protocol in the background to allow the nodes to communicate with each other and detect any faulty nodes in the cluster.

Component
	Node
	Data Center collection of related nodes
	Commit log crash/recovery mechanism. Every write operation is written in this file.
	Mem table  after commit log data will be written in memory mem tables
	SSTable disk file where data is flushed
